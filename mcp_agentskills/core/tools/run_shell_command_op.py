    """Operation for running shell commands in a subprocess.

    This tool executes shell commands and can automatically detect and
    install dependencies for script files (Python, JavaScript, Shell).
    The command is executed in the skill's directory context, allowing
    scripts to access skill-specific files and resources.

    The operation will:
    1. Extract skill_name and command from input
    2. Get the skill directory from {service_config.metadata["skill_dir"]} / {skill_name}
    3. Change to the skill directory before executing the command
    4. For Python commands, automatically detect and install dependencies
       using pipreqs (if available and auto_install_deps parameter is enabled)
    5. Execute the command in a subprocess and capture stdout/stderr
    6. Return the combined output

    Returns:
        str: The combined stdout and stderr output from the command execution.
            The output is decoded as UTF-8 and stripped of leading/trailing
            whitespace, with stdout and stderr concatenated with a newline.

    Note:
        - The skill_name must exist in `C.service_config.metadata["skill_dir"]`
        - The command is executed in the skill's directory using `cd {skill_dir}/{skill_name} && {command}`
        - For Python commands (containing "py"), the tool attempts to auto-install
          dependencies using pipreqs if it's available in the system PATH and
          the auto_install_deps parameter is enabled
        - If pipreqs is not available or dependency installation fails, a warning
          is logged but the command execution continues

        Executes a shell command in the specified skill's directory. For Python
        commands, the method attempts to automatically detect and install
        dependencies using pipreqs before executing the command.

        The method:
        1. Extracts skill_name and command from input_dict
        2. Looks up the skill directory from skill_metadata_dict
        3. For Python commands (containing "py"), checks if pipreqs is available
        4. If pipreqs is available, generates requirements.txt and installs dependencies
        5. Constructs the full command as `cd {skill_dir} && {command}`
        6. Executes the command in a subprocess with the current environment
        7. Captures stdout and stderr output
        8. Returns the combined output (stdout + stderr)

        Returns:
            None: The result is set via `self.set_output()` with the combined
                stdout and stderr output from the command execution. The output
