"""Operation for loading skill metadata.

This module provides the LoadSkillMetadataOp class which scans the skills
directory recursively and extracts metadata (name and description) from all
SKILL.md files. The metadata is parsed from YAML frontmatter in each SKILL.md
file and returned a string in the format:
    ```
    Available skills (each line is "- <skill_name>: <skill_description>"):\n
    - <skill_name_1>: <skill_description_1>\n
    - <skill_name_2>: <skill_description_2>\n
    ...
    - <skill_name_n>: <skill_description_n>\n
    ```
This string can be used to display all available skills.
