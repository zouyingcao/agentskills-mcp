"""Operation for reading reference files from skills.

This module provides the ReadReferenceFileOp class which allows reading
reference files (e.g., forms.md, reference.md, ooxml.md) from skill directories.
The skill directory is read from {service_config.metadata["skill_dir"]} /
{skill_name}. If the file is not found, an error message is returned.

    """Operation for reading reference files from a skill directory.

    This tool allows reading reference files like forms.md, reference.md,
    or ooxml.md from a specific skill's directory. The skill directory is
    read from {service_config.metadata["skill_dir"]} / {skill_name}.

    The tool:
    1. Takes a skill_name and file_name as input
    2. Gets the skill directory from {service_config.metadata["skill_dir"]}/{skill_name}
    3. Constructs the file path as {skill_dir}/{file_name}
    4. Reads the file content if it exists
    5. Returns the file content or an error message if not found

    Returns:
        str: The content of the reference file read from the skill directory.
            If the file is not found, returns an error message string indicating
            that the file was not found in the specified skill.

    Note:
        - The skill_name must exist in `C.service_config.metadata["skill_dir"]`
        - The file_name can be a simple filename (e.g., "reference.md") or a
          relative path within the skill directory
        - File encoding is assumed to be UTF-8
        - The file path is constructed as: {skill_dir}/{file_name}
