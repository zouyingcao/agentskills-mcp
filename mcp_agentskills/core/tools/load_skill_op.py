"""Operation for loading a specific skill.

This module provides the LoadSkillOp class which loads the content of a
SKILL.md file from a specified skill directory. The skill directory is
read from {service_config.metadata["skill_dir"]} / {skill_name}. If the
SKILL.md file contains YAML frontmatter, only the content after the
frontmatter is returned; otherwise, the full file content is returned.
